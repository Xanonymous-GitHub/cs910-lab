= Introduction
Since ancient times, auroras have been recognized by humans as a precious natural phenomenon full of mystery. With the advancement of transportation and the flourishing of the tourism industry, more and more people are eager to travel to specific locations to observe auroras with their own eyes. However, auroras are not always visible everywhere and may not be clearly identifiable even when they do appear. In this paper, we will explore the reasons for the occurrence of auroras and analyze the impact of various earth and space environments on the formation of auroras, such as the location of auroras, the timing of their appearance, their intensity, and so on.
