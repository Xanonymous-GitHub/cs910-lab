= Introduction
Since ancient times, auroras have been recognized by humans as a precious natural phenomenon full of mystery. With the advancement of transportation and the flourishing of the tourism industry, more and more people are eager to travel to specific locations to observe auroras with their own eyes. However, auroras are not always visible everywhere and may not be clearly identifiable even when they do appear. In this paper, we will explore the reasons for the occurrence of auroras and analyze the impact of various earth and space environments on the formation of auroras, such as the location of auroras, the timing of their appearance, their intensity, and so on.

= Background
The auroras we often talk about are a type of colorful light bands that appear in the sky, sometimes observable with the naked eye, floating slowly like clouds or mist. The primary cause of their formation is charged particles from space, such as solar wind, colliding with the Earth's magnetic field. Auroras usually appear near the Earth's Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The auroras that appear at the North Pole are called "Aurora Borealis," and those at the South Pole are known as "Aurora Australis." @aurora-in-a-bottle\ \
The actual reason for the appearance of the light bands is that when charged particles collide with atmospheric molecules, electrons, influenced by the Earth's magnetic field, accelerate @grand-aurora-seen. Then, upon colliding with atmospheric molecules, they transfer their kinetic energy, converting it into the potential energy of the atmospheric molecules. This raises the molecules to a higher state, leading them to emit photons and thereby forming a localized abnormal state in certain areas. In the solar system, the Earth is constantly bombarded by high-energy particles from all directions, and our atmosphere acts as a protective shield against these impacts. Among these charged particles, solar wind is the primary source of impact, and the strength of the solar wind depends on the solar activity itself.\ \
The Earth is a planet composed of multiple layers of different structures of solids and liquids. From the inside out, it can be broadly divided into the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. Among these, the core, mantle, and crust are mainly composed of various metals and non-metals, while the outer core and mantle undergo continuous flow due to factors such as pressure, temperature, and the decay of radioactive elements. Because of this, there is relative movement between the outer core and the mantle, which is the main reason for the Earth's magnetic field generation @dynamos.\ \
Inside the Sun, there is also relative movement between its internal geological layers. Therefore, like Earth, the Sun is a huge generator, possessing a massive solar magnetic field @solar-magnetic-field. Unlike Earth, however, the surface of the Sun is characterized by numerous high-temperature convective currents @solar-votices. These convective currents, distributed in various areas, form regional magnetic fields on the surface of the Sun, leading to certain surface activities such as sunspots, solar coronas, and so on @small-solar-magnetic-fields @solar-luminosity.\ \
Influenced by the activities on the Sun's surface, nuclear fusion reactions continuously occur @fusion-laser, leading to the charged particles on the Sun's surface possessing extremely high kinetic energy. When this kinetic energy accumulates to a certain level, these particles convert their kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy and then constantly detach from the Sun's corona, radiating into space @mass-inertia and forming what is known as the solar wind.\ \
When the solar wind passes by Earth, the Earth's magnetic field alters the trajectory of the solar wind, guiding electrons and other high-energy particles along the magnetic field lines to concentrate in the thermosphere at the geomagnetic north and south poles, where they collide with atmospheric molecules @double-oval-uv. The Earth's magnetic field is affected by geomagnetic quiet periods and geomagnetic storms, causing changes and differences in magnetic field density. Around approximately 67 degrees north and south latitude, the magnetic field activity is at its maximum @high-latitude-magnetic-field. When magnetic field activity intensifies, it causes the auroral zone to expand towards the equatorial region @space-weather.\ \
To easily observe auroras with the naked eye, observers should be located at high latitudes and in a place that is cold, clear, cloudless, and dark at night @darkness-and-light. Therefore, countries like Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Canada have suitable locations for observing the Northern Lights, while Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Chile in South America are suitable for observing the Southern Lights.
